# eduroam-icinga
This repository provides an overview of monitoring of czech eduroam infrastructure.
The core of monitoring is Icinga 2. This is intended as a complete guide on how to setup up eduroam monitoring for any other NRENs wishing to
monitor their national eduroam infrastructure.

All the links below should provide a decent understanding of the setup.
They can also be used as a step by step guide to set up eduroam monitoring at national level.

## issues

Since deployment to production we discovered some issues with our setup. Detailts in separate [page](https://github.com/CESNET/eduroam-icinga/blob/master/doc/known_issues.md)

## Auxiliary tools

These tools are not a part of monitoring setup itself,
but they provide additional valuable data in good form.
All the tools are in separate [repository](https://github.com/CESNET/eduroam-monitor).
