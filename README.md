# eduroam-icinga
This repository contains all the auxiliary tools for monitoring of czech eduroam infrastructure.
The core of monitoring is icinga2. This is intended as a complete guide on how to setup up eduroam monitoring for any other NRENs wishing to 
monitor their national eduroam infrastructure.

All the links below should provide a decent understanding of the setup.
They can also be used as a step by step guide to set up eduroam monitoring at national level.
