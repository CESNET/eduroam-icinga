# director configuration

This summarizes director configuration.
All the configuration is done via icingaweb2 director section. 
Because the configuration is done in gui, is is hard to document it. 
Director provides an export and import features through icingacli which help documentation process a lot.
Nevertheless it is also documented where to do this in icingaweb2.
